  title: 'The Hobbit - A Journey Into Maturity',
  author: 'Green, William H.',
  description: 'This fantasy favourite of children and adolescents has neither children, nor women as main characters. Nevertheless, William Green\'s discussion reveals the sexual symbolism and gender relations in the story of Bilbo Baggins, the homebody hobbit who goes adventuring in spite of himself. By showing us that it is really the story of an adolescent\'s journey into maturity, Green explains why the book became a cult classic in the 1960s. By examining Tolkien\'s spatial imagery he demonstrates the depth of this literary work, identifying it as more than just a prequel to The Lord of the Rings.',
